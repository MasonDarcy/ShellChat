# ShellChat

## What is ShellChat?

Shellchat is a prototype collaboration tool. It is meant to act similarly to a computer terminal shell, with users using 
text-based commands to interact with the service, as opposed to graphical artifacts like buttons. 
It includes some basic web service features.

* Signup
* Session-based login and logout
* Chat and channel joining 
* Adding friends, direct messaging
* Launching channel activities

## Channel activities

Currently, one channel activity is implemented. It allows multiple users in a channel to collaborate and edit Javascript code together
in real time, and to run the code and view the result together.
